This could be automated using a network management system that monitors PRB utilization and switches off cells when their utilization falls below the threshold for a sustained period.\n",

Actual savings will depend on the power consumption of each cell and the duration of the switch-off periods. A detailed power consumption model would be needed to provide a precise estimate. However, a rough estimate could be obtained by assuming a certain percentage of energy savings per cell switched off (e.g., 30-50%) and multiplying that by the number of cells switched off and the duration of the switch-off periods.\n",
