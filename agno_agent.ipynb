The actual savings will depend on the power consumption of each cell and the duration for which they are switched off. A detailed power consumption analysis would be required to provide a more accurate estimate. However, based on typical telecom equipment power consumption, energy savings could range from 10-30% during off-peak hours for the cells that are switched off.\n",
